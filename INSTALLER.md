![](https://github.com/lnbits/nostr-zap-lamp/raw/main/img/lamp.jpg)

Get a visual Zap! when someone zaps your or anyone on Nostr.

The Nostr Zap Lamp flashes when a relay broadcasts a Nostr event of kind 9735. You can set the lamp to flash zaps sent to a specific npub, or any npub on nostr.

The number of flashes corresponds to the number of digits in the number of sats sent. i.e. 3 sats will result in 1 flash, 152 sats will result in 3 flashes, 1001 sats will result in 4 flashes.
