# Nostr Zap Lamp

![](https://github.com/lnbits/nostr-zap-lamp/raw/main/img/lamp.jpg)

Get a visual "Zap!"" when someone zaps you or anyone on Nostr.

The Nostr Zap Lamp flashes when a relay broadcasts a Nostr event of kind 9735. You can set the lamp to flash zaps sent to a specific npub, or any npub.

The number of flashes corresponds to the number of digits in the number of sats sent. i.e. 3 sats will result in 1 flash, 152 sats will result in 3 flashes, 1001 sats will result in 4 flashes.
